This project is made possible thanks to UNC Summer of Code for matching a team of 6 students from UNC - Chapel Hill to a project with CARVR and Arts Everywhere. The team spent six rigerous weeks building, testing, debugging, and polishing Art On Franklin and made tremendous success. We had a lot of fun putting this project together and we hope to continue adding amazing new features to support our local business on Franklin Street.
