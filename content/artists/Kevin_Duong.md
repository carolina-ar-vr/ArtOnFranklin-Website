Photography was an outlet that allowed me to cope with the sadness and loneliness I experienced during the social isolation that was mandated on all of us to keep each other safe. I’m currently working on self-portraits due to the social limitations of the pandemic but also in an act of finding my self-worth: that I am worthy of being in front of the lens and from my creativity and two hands I can create something beautiful and cause an emotional response in people when they look at my art. Being only 20 years old and experimenting with photography for only a year I will continue to tirelessly develop my own style and find my voice to ultimately help others find their own.
