My name is Nique Lomax, and I'm currently working towards a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at The University of Chapel Hill. I am a self-taught artist that uses programs such as Cinema4D, Adobe Photoshop, and World Machine to create artistic photos. I draw inspiration from several different styles of art but mostly enjoy creating "Sci-Fi" style artwork as I think it allows for a way to have more freedom with being creative. My goal is to continue exploring different art techniques for creating better art on a daily basis and showcase that process.
