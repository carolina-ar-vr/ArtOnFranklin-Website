 - *“In Communion” at [Franklin St Yoga](http://www.franklinstyoga.com/)*

“In Communion” is about remembering that we are never alone. We are a physical manifestation of those who have gone before us and those who will come after us. By being in communion and in community, we can overcome any moment in time.
