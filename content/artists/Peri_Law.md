##### [Artist Website](https://www.perijlaw.com/)

Peri Law is a printmaker and mixed media artist from Charlotte, North Carolina. Her art explores the idea of a visual atmosphere as a liminal space. Atmosphere surrounds everything but remains out of reach, and intangible abstraction that remains in a transitional state. Liminality and memory are created through her physical process of layered and repetitive printmaking. The physical labor of creating each work is a meditative practice that grounds the self in the process of production.
She is a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where she received a BFA in studio art and art history. Her work has been exhibited throughout North Carolina, including the Levine Museum, McColl Center, Durham Art Guild, and UNC Chapel Hill.
