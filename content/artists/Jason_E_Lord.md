Jason Lord has been making art, performing, and teaching the arts to elementary, middle, and high school students in Durham and Orange counties since 1996, moving from music and theater in his early career into arts integration and visual art more recently. Currently, he's taking a hiatus from teaching to pursue a Studio Art degree at UNC.
 
##### Featured art in Art Walk on Franklin

 - *“Downtown’s Dead” at [Cosmic Cantina](https://menupages.com/cosmic-cantina/128-e-franklin-st-chapel-hill)*


Downtown's Dead is made of cyanotype prints of street images and papers found on daily walks during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It's a reflection on legacy and how we pass knowledge, policy, infrastructure, and the natural world on to next generations.
