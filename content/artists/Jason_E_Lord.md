Jason Lord has been making art, performing, and teaching the arts to elementary, middle, and high school students in Durham and Orange counties since 1996, moving from music and theater in his early career into arts integration and visual art more recently. Currently, he's taking a hiatus from teaching to pursue a Studio Art degree at UNC.
